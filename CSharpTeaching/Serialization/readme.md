# Serialization exercise

## Objective

Illustrate how to serialize and deserialize objects.

The inventory class (``Inventory.cs``) keeps track of all articles that have been stored.
The inventory class identifies each article (``Article.cs``) by an unique ID.
Each article consists of a name and a corresponding price.

## Tasks

* Make the classes defined in ``Article.cs`` and ``Inventory.cs`` classes serializable
* Write the ``Serialize`` and ``Deserialize`` methods in ``Inventory.cs``
* Check the output file of the serialization
